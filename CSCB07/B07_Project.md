## üöÄ Logistics

> For more information, see the [project handout PDF](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/226213/assignments/741736?module_item_id=3137904)

- 26 Students currently $\Rightarrow$ approx. **5 students per group**

- TA (me) will be the product owner, **one** member of your group is the Scrum Master

- Three Meetings with the TA (me):
	- Week 9: Lab 6 - Project Introduction
	- Week 10: Demo 1 (1/2 way)
	- Week 11: Demo 2 + Project Completion 

- This project must be version controlled, *it is recommended to use* [GitHub](https://github.com/) *if available in your country*
  - Any group member can create the repository, and the TA (me) must have access to it
  - You can keep the repository as `Private` for development, but for submission, it *must* be `Public`. [Here's how to do that](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility)
  
  - Brownie points for groups that follow good version control practices (Git-flow, Clean Git commit history, Squash and/or Rebase Merging, etc.), **_this is not mandatory!_**
  
  - My GitHub Account (to add me as a collaborator): [navn-r](https://github.com/navn-r)
  
  
  

## üéâ Submission and Deliverables

> You will *not* lose marks if you don‚Äôt follow this, however doing so will make your life easier, and mine.

### During Development

- All Scrum documents should be stored in the `/docs` folder of the repository, you will need to make this folder

- You must make a  file called `/docs/agreement.txt` (You can use `.md` also, any plain text format is fine) and contains

  - Name of all group members (Indicate which member is the Scrum Master)
  - Primary Method of communication (Discord, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, etc.)
  - Scheduled times for all daily standup meetings (e.g. Weekdays at 17:00 EST)
  - Where the project will be Version Controlled (GitHub (recommended), GitLab, SVN, etc.)
  - Anything else that is relevant to the group and project

- Standup documents should be stored in `/docs/standups` folder, again you will need to make this

  - Each file in that folder should follow this file format `MM-DD.txt` (You can use `.md` also, any plain text format is fine)

  - In each file, use this template **_for each group member_**. There should be about 5 of these inside the file.

    ```txt
    Name: 
    
    What have you done since yesterday?
    	- Put points here ...
     
    What are you planning on doing today?
    	- Put points here ...
    	
    Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
    	- Put points here ...
    ```

- Example Screenshot of the file structure:

### After Development (Submission Time)

1. You must archive the repository (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.rar`, `.7z`, etc.). You can *easily* do this through GitHub by clicking **Code**

![download zip](https://i2.paste.pics/66c55ba6a2d72ec756f020e1190e7716.png)

2. The Scrum Master will email the archive to the instructor, and CC the TA (me) *and* the other group members 

	- Include the URL of the repository in the email
