### Lab Logistics

>  Due at the end of the week; Worth 1% each

Tutorial attendance is **mandatory**. An exemption is only given if the student sends an email to their TA (me), by the deadline for the lab, so **end of the week**. The purpose of the emails is just to prevent students from skipping them. Honestly, the TAs aren't looking for an insanely detailed reason or anything, I just need an email.

Alternatively, if you decide to go to an earlier tutorial in the week due to conflicts or if something comes up, just shoot me an email and I'll make note.

 The lab marking scheme goes as follows:

- **0%** if the student does not attend the lab and does not submit anything, *or* they attend the lab and not submit anything, *or* **they do not attend the lab, do not email their TA,** **and submit the lab on time**
  
- **0.5%** if the student attends the lab or sends an email, and submits their lab on time, but it's wrong or just bad (the labs are easy enough to not get this mark tbh)

- **1%** if the student attends the lab or sends an email, and submits their lab on time, and its decent (doesn't have to be super  well done, just good enough)
  

Do note that although this marking scheme is not noted in the syllabus, the attendance/email stuff is mentioned in the 'Logistics'  section of each lab document.
