Type *type_name = (Type *)malloc(numOfElements, sizeOf(Type)); free(type_name); //same as calloc     Dynamic Arrays  Taking the best parts of Arrays ($O(1)$ lookup, consecutive boxes in memory) but without fixed length constraint.\n Essentially, when an array of size $N$ is at capacity (check using a counter variable), create a new array of size $2N$, and copy existing elements over to the new array\nint *infiniteChocolateCopy(int someChocolate[n], int n) { int *moreChocolate = (int *)calloc(2 * n, sizeOf(int)); // allocates size 2n on the heap  for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++) { //iterates through someChocolate  *(moreChcolate + i) = someChocolate[i]; //copies over  } return moreChocolate; }   Compound Data Types  Storing multiple components of data types (primitive and/or compound), packaged into a single container. Used when storing information too complex for a single data type.\n Defining a CDT struct: typedef struct student_struct { // creates the struct  char name[1024]; int year; double gpa; Markbook *marks; // example of passing a CDT pointer (CDT-ception)  // as many as you want here } Student; Initializing a CDT: Student *sweaty_nerd = (Student *)calloc(1, sizeOf(Student)); // allocate memory strcpy(sweaty_nerd-\u0026gt;name, \u0026#34;TryHard on Piazza\u0026#34;); // for strings sweaty_nerd-\u0026gt;year = 2023; // arrow (-\u0026gt;) operator for pointers sweaty_nerd-\u0026gt;gpa = 2.718; sweaty_nerd-\u0026gt;marks = bad_marks; Memory Model:  CDT\u0026rsquo;s get one locker for all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents (like a Bento Box) Passing a CDT into a function: myCDT randomCrunchyCDTFunction(myCDT crunch) { // makes a copy (not passed-by-ref)  ... return crunch //returns a copy } It is typical to pass and return CDTs as a pointer, instead of copying\n    Abstract Data Types  Implementation independent! It is just the idea of a container that stores a collection of data.\n List ADT:  Stores items sequentially in nodes not necessarily consecutive, containing a reference to the next node in the list Not fixed in length Head: 1st node in list Tail: last node in list Typical operations, $O(N)$ worst case:  Insert Remove Update Search   Queue ADT: FIFO (first-in-first-out) Stack ADT: FILO (first-in-last-out)  Linked List:  Best used when data is added and queried in random order.\n   Basic dynamic implementation of List ADT\ntypedef struct linked_list_struct { int data // payload (can be any type)  struct linked_list_struct *next; // pointer to the next node in the list, NULL if tail node } ListNode;   Iterating through a Linked List\nfor(ListNode *n = head; n != NULL; n = n-\u0026gt;next);   Insert\n  At head - $O(1)$ complexity:\nListNode *wantToInsert = (ListNode *)calloc(1, sizeOf(ListNode)); wantToInsert-\u0026gt;data = 51 // coincidentally the course midterm average wantToInsert-\u0026gt;next = head; // where head is the head of the LL   At tail - $O(N)$ complexity:\n//same initialzation of wantToInsert as 1. ListNode *n = head; if(head != NULL) { // always check if head is not null to avoid errors  for(; n-\u0026gt;next != NULL; n = n-\u0026gt;next); // traverses until at the tail  n-\u0026gt;next = wantToInsert; // sets the tail as wantToInsert }   Somewhere in between\n//same initialzation of wantToInsert as 1. ListNode *n = head; if(head != NULL) { for(; n-\u0026gt;data != insertHereNum; n = n-\u0026gt;next); // traverses list  wantToInsert-\u0026gt;next = n-\u0026gt;next; // links wantToInsert to n-\u0026gt;next  n-\u0026gt;next = wantToInsert; // links n to wantToInsert } Note: When inserting inside the list, we would use a condition to compare unique identifiers so we know exactly where to insert. For this example we assumed all the numbers were distinct and we knew insertHereNum's value was given and inside the Linked List.\n    Search - $O(N)$\n Traverse from head Check if current node is the desired node using a compare operation/function (see Note) Return  A pointer of the desired node, user can modify the node and list A copy of the data type (compound/primitive), user cannot modify the node and list      Delete - $O(N)$\nListNode *p1 = head; ListNode *p2 = NULL; // is always 1 node behind p1 if(head != NULL) { for(; p1 != NULL \u0026amp;\u0026amp; p1-\u0026gt;data != wantedNum; p2 = p1, p1 = p1-\u0026gt;next); //traverses through LL, one behind the other until wantedNode is found  if(p1-\u0026gt;data == head-\u0026gt;data) p2 = head-\u0026gt;next; // only if the wantedNode is the head  else p2-\u0026gt;next = p1-\u0026gt;next; // all other cases, links the node before wantedNode with the node after  free(p1); // releases the node from the list }     Unit 4:   Computational Complexity:  Measuring the amount of work done by an algorithm as a function of the number of data items the algorithm is working on, and thus predicting how algorithms will preform against each other without having to test on large $N$ values.\n The Big $O$ Notation  Comparing algorithms in a machine and implementation dependent manner.\n   Mathematically put, $$ f(x) = O(g(x)) \\iff \\exists c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\u0026gt;0} \\text{ such that for sufficiently large } x \\text{, } \\newline |f(x)| ≤ c \\text{ } \\cdotp{g(x)}, \\quad x \u0026gt; x_0 $$\n$O(g(x))$ is the smallest function of $N$ that puts an upper bound on $x$\n  Given a set of candidate algorithms, the fastest algorithm will have the slowest growing Big $O$ complexity.\n  In terms of efficiency, $$ O(1) \u0026lt; O(log (N)) \u0026lt; O(N) \u0026lt; O(Nlog(N)) \u0026lt; O(N^2) \u0026lt; O(N^3) \u0026lt; O(2^N) \u0026lt; O(N!) $$\n  Binary Search for Arrays  Array must be sorted Complexity of $O(log_2(N))$ Procedure (Pseudocode): int binarySearch(int wantedNum, int Array[]) { int middleNum = Array[floor(length / 2.0)]; // finds middle index (floor if odd length)  if(wantedNum == middleNum) { return index(middleNum); // returns index of middleNum in Array  } else if (wantedNum \u0026gt; middleNum) { binarySearch(wantedNum, Lower Half of Array); // all values greater than middleNum  } else { binarySearch(wantedNum, Upper Half of Array); // all values less than middleNum  } }   Complexity of Linked Lists versus Arrays  All basic operations on a Linked List have worst case $O(N)$ complexity. Unsorted Array:  Search:  Index lookup: $O(1)$ Linear search: $O(N)$ Sort: make a reasonable assumption :^)     Sorted Array:  Search:  Index lookup: $O(1)$ Binary Search: $O(log(N))$      The Consequence of Sorting   Bubble Sort:\n Traverse the array and swap adjacent decreasing entries until the array is sorted.\n Worst-Case Complexity: $O(N^2)$\nvoid notSoCrunchyBubbleSort(int array[], int N) { for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; N; i++) { // N iterations  for(int j = 0; j \u0026lt; N - 1; j++) { // N - 1 iterations  if(array[j] \u0026lt; array[j-1]) { // compares if the adj. entries are decreasing  swap(array[j], array[j+1]); } } } }   Quick Sort (qsort):\n Choose a random pivot, split elements into 2 arrays: values less than the pivot, and values greater than or equal to the pivot. Repeat until all sub-arrays have lengths ≤ 1. Reconstruct the now sorted array.\n  Average-Case Complexity: $O(Nlog(N))$ (not so crunchy) Worst-Case Complexity: $O(N^2)$ (first/last entry pivot $\\rightarrow$ insertion sort)    Insertion Sort:\n Build the sorted array in place (no splits), shifting elements as we traverse the array to sort.\n  Best-Case Complexity: $O(N)$ Worst-Case Complexity: $O(N^2)$ Procedure:  Choose first element to be \u0026ldquo;sorted\u0026rdquo; Look at next element in array, and insert it inside the \u0026ldquo;sorted\u0026rdquo; portion by comparing it to the values in said portion. Repeat 2. until the end of array        Trees  A generalization of Linked Lists, linking one node in the Tree to sucessor (children) nodes. Recursive in nature, each sub-tree is also a Tree.\n Binary-Search Trees (BST)  Variation of a Binary Tree (left and right children only) such that the BST property holds for each node and duplicate nodes are not allowed.\n   BST Property:\n Data in nodes on the left sub-tree are less than or equal to data in the root node Data in nodes on the right sub-tree are greater than data in the root node    Basic Implementation\ntypedef struct dollarStoreChocolate_BST_Struct { int data; struct dollarStoreChocolate_BST_Struct *left; // left child pointer  struct dollarStoreChocolate_BST_Struct *right; // right child pointer } BST_Node   Search - $O(log(N))$:\nif(root == NULL) return NULL; else if(givenData == root-\u0026gt;data) // check root  return root; else if(givenData \u0026lt;= root-\u0026gt;data) return search(root-\u0026gt;left, givenData); // search left sub-tree else return search(root-\u0026gt;right, givenData); // search right sub-tree   Insert - $O(log(N))$\n// assuming new_node was initialized and correctly allocated to the heap if (root == NULL) // empty tree  return new_node; // inserts at root else if (new_node-\u0026gt;data \u0026gt; root-\u0026gt;data) root-\u0026gt;right = insert(root-\u0026gt;right, new_node); // inserts in right sub-tree else root-\u0026gt;left = insert(root-\u0026gt;left, new_node); // inserts in left sub-tree return root; Note: Just like Linked Lists, we must use our own comparison function if the data in the node is a CDT.\n  Traversal - $O(N)$\n In Order - For listing a BST in sorted order: if (root != NULL) { inOrder(root-\u0026gt;left); // traverses left sub-tree  printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, root-\u0026gt;data); // any operation can be preformed  inOrder(root-\u0026gt;right); // traverses right sub-tree }  Pre Order - For Copying an entire BST: if (root != NULL) { printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, root-\u0026gt;data); // operation  preOrder(root-\u0026gt;left); // traverses left sub-tree  preOrder(root-\u0026gt;right); // traverses right sub-tree }  Post Order - For deleting an entire BST: if (root != NULL) { inOrder(root-\u0026gt;left); // traverses left sub-tree  inOrder(root-\u0026gt;right); // traverses right sub-tree  printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, root-\u0026gt;data); // operation }     Delete - $O(log(N))$\n Searching for node to delete is the same implementation as Insert and Search No children: free(root); // if only the final exam was as simple as this  One Child:  Left only BST_Node *temp = root-\u0026gt;left; // points to left child free(root); return temp;  Right only BST_Node *temp = root-\u0026gt;right; // points to right child free(root); return temp;    Two Children: BST_Node *temp = find_successor(root-\u0026gt;right); // smallest node in the right subtree copyNode(root, temp); // copies all the data from temp to the root root-\u0026gt;right = delete(temp); // deletes the successor recursively return root;     Complexity of Binary Search Trees versus Linked Lists and Arrays   Building the data structure:\n LL: $O(N)$ BST: $O(Nlog(N))$ Array + Merge Sort: $O(Nlog(N))$    Search:\n LL / Unsorted Array: $O(N)$ BST: $O(Log(N))$ Sorted Array: $O(Log(N))$    Space Complexity:\n Array: Fixed size LL: $O(N)$ BST: $O(N)$      Unit 5:   Graphs:  A model to represent items and their relationships between them. Composed of Nodes (Verticies) and Edges, with optional direction and weight.\n $$ G=(V,E) $$\nGraph Representation   Direction:\n Undirected: Two way relationship Directed: One way relationship    Neighbourhood:\n The neighbourhood of Node U is the set of all nodes that are neighbours of Node U.\n   Neighbour: 2 Nodes are considered neighbours if they are joined by an edge\nDirected Example: Node U $\\rightarrow$ Node V\n  In-neighbour: U of V\n  Out-neightbour: V of U\n  In-neighbourhood: Edges arriving at Node U\n  Out-neighbourhood: Edges leaving Node U\n      Degree:\n The size/dimension (number of nodes) in the neigbourhood of the Node.\n  In-degree: Degree of In-neighbourhood Out-degree: Degree of Out-neighbourhood    Traversals:\n Breadth First Search (BFS) - By path of neighbours Depth First Search (DFS) - Level by level    General Applications of Graphs   Social Networks\n  Transportation (Maps services)\n  Genomics and Bioinformatics\n  Computer Networks and the Internet\n  Representing Graphs   Adjacency List:\n An array with one entry per node. Each entry points to a linked list containing the neigbourhood for that node.\n   Adjacency Matrix:\n A 2D $N\\text{ x }N$ matrix, $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. If Node $i$ and Node $j$ share an edge then AdjMat[$i$][$j$] \u0026gt; 0. For Undirected graphs, AdjMat[$i$][$j$] $=$ AdjMat[$j$][$i$]\n   Operation Complexity on Graphs  $N = |\\text{Vertices}|$ is the number of nodes in the graph, and $M= |\\text{Edges}|$ is the number of edges in the graph\n     Operation Adjacency List Adjacency Matrix     Edge Query $O(N)$ $O(1)$   Inserting a Node $O(1)$ $O(N^2)$   Removing a Node $O(M)$ $O(N^2)$   Inserting an edge $O(1)$ $O(1)$   Removing an edge $O(N)$ $O(1)$       Principles of Recursion:  The repeated application of a recursive procedure. Can make some problems super trivial to solve.\n Types of problems that benefit from recursion:  Sudoku, N Queens (pretty c r u n c h y) BST Operations (duh) Graph Operations (every sub-graph is still a graph) Search and Path Finding (BFS and DFS)   Generally any problem that contains a smaller version of itself as a sub-problem.\n The process of designing a recursive solution  Base Case(s):  Specific to the problem itself, multiple can exist The smallest problem with a trivial solution Any solution must always reach the base case   Recursive Case:  Multiple ways to split the problem at hand, some better than others After each recursive call, the sub-problem must be closer to the base case Always best to visually interpret/draw out the solution    Recursive Sort and their complexities   DoofusSort/chewySort/notAProGamerSort:\n First Entry goes into one sub-array, the rest into another Recursively sort each sub-array Merge to form the sorted array  Complexity:\n Worst Case: $O(N^2)$ (Essentially Insertion Sort)    Merge Sort:\n Choose the middle entry as pivot Split into 2 sub-arrays, one less than, one greater than or equal Recursively sort each sub-array Combine to form the sorted array  Complexity:\n Worst Case: $O(Nlog(N))$ (Super Duper Crunchy)    qsort:\nSee: The Consequences of Sorting\n  The Memory Model  Each time a recursive call has been made, part of the stack is reserved (stack frame) for variables, parameters and return type. Each stack frame will only be cleared until each recursive call is completed.\n  Stack Overflow (like the webpage):  Results when the stack has ran out of empty space Recursive solution must reach the base case in a reasonable number of steps Tail Recursion can prevent this  The recursive call would be the last thing the function does before returning Similar to an iterative solution, better for DEEP recursive solutions        Unit 6:   Software Design:  Developers are lazy, we need modular solutions to be as useful for others as possible.\n Properties of good software design   Modularity\n Does one thing, ridonkulously well. Minimizes code replication Simplifies testing and debugging    Reusablity\n Any module can be reused by other applications requiring that specific task.    Extendibility\n Software that is easy to improve and extend its functionality and usability.    Maintainablity\n Organized, explicit and so well-commented that a noob would understand it.    Correctness\n Devs may be lazy, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t super lazy. Include detailed documentation and test cases.    Efficiency\n Gotta go fast, $O(1)$ or bust.    Openness\n You\u0026rsquo;re not a giant tech company, contribute to the open source software community.    Privacy and Security\n Secure data exchanges and reliable and safe solutions over personal/enterprise networks.      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  Interacting with software modules, without having to understand how they work internally.\n  Use-case: Specific situation in which components of the API may be used Dependency: The relationship of one module requiring another module in order to function  Properties of a good API  Easy to maintain Easy to extend and improve Easy to learn Difficult to use incorrectly Suitable for those who will be using it  Expanding an API  Must consider required use-cases for each module Applications that rely on the API must not experience any significant impacts if expanded  Method overloading is a good workaround for any CRUNCHY use-cases after the initial rollout   If a bad API is expanded/modified, any software relying on said API will most likely stop functioning correctly  Limitations of C  Basically C is !(OOP).\n  No Encapsulation and Information hiding No Polymorphism or Inheritance No Method overloading    Object Oriented Programming (OOP)  Model for developing software components based on Encapsulation.\n  Encapsulation:  Wrapping required components together to implment the functionality of a data type. Hides data and functionality from the user using Access Control Modifiers to prevent misuse.   Access Control Modifiers:  Private: Accessed only by the class that its in  Protected: Gives inherited classes access to the parent class\u0026rsquo;s private data   Public: Can be accessed by any code outside of the class    Method Overloading  Methods with the same name, but with different input parameters, return type and implementation.\n   Useful for multiple use-cases in which that particular solution is needed\nExample (Java):\npublic int addNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; } // same name but different return type and input parameters public double addNumbers(double a, double b, double c) { return a + b + c; } _\n  Classes and Objects  The template/blueprint for building objects and their variables and methods.\n  Components of a class:  Private member variables  Used inside the class only   Constructor  Creates new instances/objects Assigns values to the input paramenters for the instance   Destructor  Called when finished with the class   Object Methods  Any functions declared in the class that an object can use      An example of an object class (Java):\nclass ComputerScienceNerd { // initialize the class  // initializes member variables for ComputerScienceNerd object  private String name; private double gpa; public ComputerScienceNerd(String name, double gpa) { // object constructor  // private variables (this.) get the parameter values  this.name = name; this.gpa = gpa; } /* * Object methods, public in nature * Call the method with (ComputerScienceNerdObject).method(); */ String getName() { return name; } double getGPA() { return gpa; } void screech() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;bY ThE WaY, dId yOu kNoW I\u0026#39;m iN CoMpUtEr sCiEnCe?\u0026#34;); } } Polymorphism and Inheritance   Inheritance:\n The idea of passing methods and definitions to a hierarchy of Children classes.\n  A Child class inherits the same \u0026ldquo;traits\u0026rdquo; as the Parent class Example:  Parent Class: Instrument Child Class: WindInstrument inherits Instrument Child Class: Flute inherits WindInstrument   The \u0026ldquo;is a(n)\u0026rdquo; Test implies possible inheritance  \u0026ldquo;Flute is an instrument\u0026rdquo; $\\rightarrow$ Flute can inherit Instrument      Polymorphism:\n The idea that similar classes should be used the same way. Different objects belonging to the same inheritence hierarchy may posses the same functions, but the behaviour is characteristic to the object itself.\n Example (Pseudocode):\nClass Instrument { Instrument() { double duration; double freq; } playNote() { play(duration, freq); // generic implementation set by Parent class  } } Class Guitar extends Instrument { // child of Instrument  Guitar() { Instrument(); // uses the same constructor as parent class  } playNote() { // overrides the playNote() from the parent  // implementation here is specific to the Guitar class  } } Class Piano extends Instrument { // child of Instrument  Piano() { Instrument(); // uses parent constructor  } playNote() { // overrides the playNote() from the parent  // implementation here is specific to the Piano class  } } Obviously, a Guitar and a Piano do not sound the same (unless you\u0026rsquo;re deaf). As a result, playNote() should be modified for each different sounding instrument. The idea/functionality of playNote() must be the same, regardless of which Child is calling it.\n  Abstract Classes  A class that only declares methods, and any subclass must provide implmentations for each method.\n  A Parent class that lets its children hold all implementations Example:  Parent Class: Instrument  Methods: playNote(), tunePitch(), smashOnSomeonesHead() No implementations   Children Classes: Piano, Guitar  Methods: Same as parent but each child has a different implementation  Piano: smashOnSomeonesHead() $\\rightarrow$ \u0026quot;Smash Head on Piano\u0026quot; Guitar: smashOnSomeonesHead() $\\rightarrow$ \u0026quot;Smash Guitar on Head\u0026quot;          "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/notes/index.html','title':"Home",'content':"Course Notes Typed notes for my undergraduate classes at the University of Toronto, Canada.\nNote that not all courses taken throughout my degree will have typed notes, due to either choosing to hand-write them (mostly for math courses), pure laziness to type, or both.\nCourse Notes thus far:\n CSCA48H3: Intro to Computer Science II  Built with Hugo using Markdown\nSite Repo\nMade with ❤️ by Navinn Ravindaran\n"});})();
