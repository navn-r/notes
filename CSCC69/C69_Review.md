# CSCC69 - Final Review
#### Winter 2023
<!-- Copilot is a joke -->
> We both know I shouldn't be writing a review for this course.

## Threads and Processes

### Concurrency
> Running multiple processes at the same time

- Able to run more processes than the number of cores
- Serial execution results in more CPU idle time waiting for I/O
- User threads are 1:1 mapped to kernel threads (`struct thread`), can also be many:1
- The OS also has its own kernel threads

![kernel threads](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1098762573832265858/image.png)

![process vs threads](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1098763231507529778/image.png)

#### Interrupts

- CPU stops running current process, saves its state, and runs interrupt handler (`threads/interrupt.c`)
- **External**: Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) handles hardware interrupts 
- **Internal**: Timer interrupts, Syscalls, Faults (page, segmentation, division by zero)

### Synchronization

- Incrementing and Decrementing are not atomic, may cause race conditions

#### Critical Section

- Code that accesses shared data and must be executed atomically

| Requirement      | Definition                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutual Exclusion | Only one thread can be in critical section at a time                 |
| Progress         | A thread in the critical section will eventually exit                |
| Bounded Waiting  | If a thread is waiting to enter critical section, eventually it will |
| Performance      | No thread should wait too long to enter critical section             |

- **Disable Interrupts**: Technically works, but can cause deadlock (thread hangs forever)

- **Semaphores**: Accessed by multiple threads
  - Contains a counter (> 0) and a list of waiting threads
  - Before entering critical section, down the semaphore
  - After, up the semaphore, waking up another thread

- **Locks**: Acquired and released by a single thread (binary semaphore)

- **Condition Variables**: Waits for a condition to be true
  ```c
  cond_init (&cond);
  cond_wait (&cond, &lock); // thread calls this to wait for condition
  cond_signal (&cond);      // wakes up one waiter 
  cond_broadcast (&cond);   // wakes all threads
  ```

  
#### Deadlock

- No process can make progress because each is waiting for an event that only another process can cause
- Avoided by acquiring resources in a fixed order (no circular wait)
- Note: Any three conditions can (likely) result in deadlock, doesn't have to be all four

| Condition        | Definition                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutual Exclusion | One process at a time can use the resource                                      |
| Hold and Wait    | A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for additional resources |
| No Preemption    | A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it           |
| Circular Wait    | P1 waiting on P2 waiting on ... PN waiting on P1                                |


### Scheduling

#### Thread Lifecycle

![thread lifecycle diagram](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1098736585861759047/image.png)

- **Scheduling Problem**: Given a set of processes, decide which process to run next, and for how long
- **Starvation**: Thread is prevented from making progress because some other thread has the resources it needs
  - i.e. a higher priority thread is preventing the lower priority thread from running

#### Scheduling Metrics

| Metric     | Definition                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Throughput | Number of processes that complete per unit time  (maximize) |
| Turnaround | `time_finished` $-$ `time_started`    (minimize)            |
| Response   | `time_responded` $-$ `time_requested`  (minimize)           |


#### Scheduling Algorithms

| Kind           | Definition                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preemptive     | OS can switch to another thread at any time                              |
| Non-Preemptive | OS can only switch to another thread after the running thread terminates |

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Can cause head-of-line blocking (long processes block short processes)

- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Must know processing time, can cause starvation (short processes starve long processes)
  - SRTF: Can consider remaining time instead of total time (preemptive), still leads to starvation
  
- **Round Robin (RR)**: Preempt current thread after time quantum (1-100ms), and continue in FIFO order
  - Doesn't consider a thread's priority, can cause starvation

- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQS)**: Preemptive, priority-based scheduling
  1. Assigned high priority initially, and priority is decreased after each time quantum
  2. A Lower priority runs only when the higher priority queue is empty
  3. If same priority, round robin is used
  4. After a job uses up its time quantum, it moves to the lower priority queue
  5. After some time, all jobs are moved back to higher priority

#### Priority Donation

- A thread can donate to a lower priority thread
- Eg. Thread H waiting for a lock held by a thread L
  - H donates to L, allowing L to schedule and release the lock
  - L returns the donation back to H to continue running

```
NESTED DONATION: "H is waiting on A held by M and M is waiting on B held by L"

|-------------------|                               |-------------------|                               |--------------------|
| thread H          |       |-------------|         | thread M          |       |-------------|         | thread L           |
|   priority: HIGH  |       | lock A      |         |   priority: MED   |       | lock B      |         |   priority: LOW    |
|   waiting_on: A   |------>|   holder: M |-------->|   waiting_on: B   |------>|  holder: L  |-------->|   waiting_on: NULL |
|___________________|       |_____________|         |___________________|       |_____________|         |____________________|
```

## Virtual Memory

- Abstraction of physical memory
- Each process has its own virtual address space
- OS maps virtual addresses to physical addresses without the process knowing other processes' addresses
- **Fragmentation**: Inability to use memory over time, avoiding this is impossible
  - **Internal**: Fixed size pieces, internal waste of space
  - **External**: Free space is not contiguous, can't allocate a large block (many small holes)
  - Factors required for Fragmentation:
    - Different lifetimes: no fragmentation if all processes have same lifetime
    - Different sizes: no fragmentation if all processes have same size

| Goal          | Definition                                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protection    | Each process has its own virtual address space                       |
| Efficiency    | Reduce memory usage and improve performance                          |
| Convenience   | Allow processes to use memory without worrying about physical memory |
| Extensibility | Allow processes to use more memory than physical memory              |

### Attempts to Solve Virtual Memory

1. **Base and Bound Registers**
   - MMU translates (and verifies) address at runtime
   - `physical_address = virtual_address - base`
   - If `base <= address <= bound`, then address is valid, else trap to OS
   - Causes internal fragmentation, growing process is expensive

2. **Segmentation**
   - Divide process into segments, each with its own base and bound
   - Address is built from segmentation table
   - Causes external fragmentation

3. **Simple Paging**
   - Divide virtual memory into fixed-size pages, physical memory into paged-sized frames
   - Each page has a page table entry (PTE) that maps virtual page to physical page
   - Eliminates external fragmentation, internal fragmentation is small 
   - Each memory lookup requires two memory accesses (page table and PTE)

![address lookup](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1098926036168736808/image.png)

4. **Multi-Level Paging**
   - Page directory contains one entry per page table (`pagedir`)
   - Lookup process: (happy path) 
       1. Fetch PTE from PDE
       2. Fetch page frame from PTE
       3. Compute physical address from page frame and offset
   - If any of the above steps fail, a page fault occurs (`userprog/exception.c:page_fault()`)
   - Allows for page growth, but now requires 3 memory accesses (time-space trade-off)
   - **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**: Cache of recently used PTEs, reduces memory accesses to 2
     - High hit rate, maintained by the MMU (hardware is always faster than software)


### Page Replacement

- **Swap**: Move a page from physical memory to disk
- When a page fault occurs, the OS must choose a page to evict from physical memory into swap
- Page replacement algorithms strive to minimize page fault rate
- **Belady's Anomaly**: Having more physical memory does not automatically mean fewer page faults

![page replacement](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1098935002638598184/image.png)

#### Page Replacement Algorithms

1. **Basic algorithms**: FIFO, LRU, LFU, MFU
  - Combinations also exist

2. **Clock Algorithm**: Approximation of LRU
  ```c
  list_init (frame_list); // circular
  clock_hand = frame_list.head; // some page frame
  for (each page access request)
  {
    if (page in memory) // hit 
    {
      page.accessed = 1;
    }
    else // miss (eviction)
    {
      while (clock_hand.accessed == 1)
      {
        clock_hand.accessed = 0;
        clock_hand = clock_hand.next;
      }

      swap (clock_hand, page);
      clock_hand = clock_hand.next;
    }
  }
  ```
3. **Second Chance**: Similar to clock algorithm, head of list after is ready to be evicted
  ```c
  void
  second_chance (void)
  {
    struct thread *cur = thread_current ();
    struct frame_table_entry *frame = get_head_frame ();
    struct sup_page_entry *spe = frame->spe;

    while (pagedir_is_accessed (frame->owner->pagedir, spe->uaddr))
    {
      pagedir_set_accessed (frame->owner->pagedir, spe->uaddr, false);
      
      // 'rotate' frame to the back of the list
      list_remove (&frame->elem);
      list_push_back (&frame_table, &frame->elem);

      frame = get_head_frame ();
      spe = frame->spe;
    }
  }
  ```

### Memory Allocation

- **Static**: Memory is allocated at compile time (fixed size, stack)
  ```c
  int a[100]; // simple, but restricted
  ```
- **Dynamic**: Memory is allocated at runtime (variable size, heap)
  ```c
  char *a = (char *) malloc (100); // contiguous block of memory
  free (a); // creates fragmentation (need to coalesce)
  ```

![heap memory allocator](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099368064115544164/image.png)


#### Allocator Data Structures

1. **Bitmap**: Array of bits, each bit represents a page
   - 0 means free, 1 means allocated
   - Allocation is slow, requires linear scan to find sequence of zeros
   - No need to coalesce

2. **Free List**: List of free pages
   - Coalescing is required to prevent fragmentation, merge adjacent blocks

![free list](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099368859468824657/image.png)


#### Placement Algorithms

1. **First Fit**: Find first free block that is large enough
   - Linear scan of free list sorted LIFO/FIFO/address, pick first one that is large enough
   - Simple, (often) fastest and most efficient
   - May cause fragmentation near start of memory that must be searched repeatedly

2. **Best Fit**: Find smallest free block that is large enough
   - Minimize fragmentation by allocating space from block that leaves smallest fragment
   - Requires linear scan of free list
   - **Worst Fit**: Find largest free block that is large enough (opposite of best fit)

3. **Buddy Allocation**: Round up allocations to power of 2 to make management faster
   - Fast search and merge (alloc and free)
   - Avoids iterating through free list
   - Avoids external fragmentation
   - Physical pages are kept contiguous

## Storage Devices

### Purpose 

- It is the OS's responsibility to abstract storage details
  - HDD only knows about platters and sectors, SSD only knows about pages and blocks
  - Neither know about files, directories, or processes, but user programs do

- **Memory/Storage Hierarchy**:
  - Balance between cost, performance, and capacity
  - CPU registers and cache are fastest, but small and expensive
  - Hard disk is slow, but large and cheap
  - Exploit locality of reference to minimize cost

- **Persistence**:
  - 'Permanent' storage of data
  - Organization, consistency, and management issues are important


### Hard Disk Drives

![insides](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099378387560173679/image.png)

- Slow for random access

- HDD workloads favor high locality and large request sizes
  - Should design FS to generate workloads that have this

- Disk service time components:
  - Seeking (expensive)
  - Rotational Latency (spinning)
  - Data transfer (reading/writing)

- Disks expose storage as a linear array of blocks
  - Blocks are 512 bytes
  - Can read/write whole blocks (nothing partial)
  - Actual location of block is unknown to the OS

**Preventing Failures**

![redundancy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099384418310832148/image.png)

### Solid State Drives

- Based on NAND flash cells, and have no moving parts
  - **SLC**: Single Level Cell (1 bit per cell)
  - **QLC**: Quad Level Cell (4 bits per cell)

- Faster, reliable, and more power efficient than HDD
  - But can only be written/erased to a limited number of times

- Cells are organized into **pages**
  
- Pages are organized into **Erase Blocks** (not the same as disk blocks)
  - Writes are only possible to erased pages

- Writes are 10x slower than reads, Erases are 10x slower than writes

- Erase Blocks are the smallest unit that can be erased
  - Causes fragmentation, requires garbage collection, usually done in the background
  - GC copies over an entire block to a new block, then erases the old (fragmented) block
  - SSDs overprovision to account for this (240GB SSD has 256GB of storage)

- GC and Wear levelling (solution to fixed number of writes) case **Write Amplification**:
  - The number of writes to the SSD is greater than the number of writes to the file system

## File Systems

### Goals

1. **Abstraction**: Hide details of storage devices from user programs (files)
   - Developed using a generic block layer (does not matter if HDD or SSD)
2. **Organization**: Organize files into directories (logically)
3. **Sharing**: Allow processes, users, and machines to share files
4. **Security**: Protect files from unauthorized access

### Disk Layout

- **inode**: Data structure to represent a file (`struct inode`)
  - Metadata: File size, permissions, owner, etc.
  - Tracks which blocks (on disk) contains the data stored in the file (`struct inode_disk`)

#### Layout Strategies

1. **Contiguous Allocation**: Allocate blocks in a contiguous sequence
   - Simple, only need to keep track of offset and length of file
   - Causes external fragmentation, gaps when a file is deleted

2. **Linked Allocation**: Allocate blocks in a linked list
   - Each block points to the next block in the file
   - Doesn't have to be contiguous, need to keep track of first and last block pointer
   - Good for sequential access, bad for all others
   
3. **Indexed Allocation**: Multi-level indirect blocks
   - 'Index' block (indirect, double indirect, triple indirect) points to other blocks
   - Need to store the index blocks on disk as well
   - Allows for very large and extendable files
   - **Freemap**: Bitmap of free blocks, used to allocate new blocks
     - Only need to allocate bit by bit, not contiguously

### UNIX File System
>  Simple, easy to use, but terrible performance due to lack of locality

![unix](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099452505303285861/image.png)

### Access Paths (UNIX)

#### Reading a file from disk

1. `open ("/foo/bar")` "Find the inode for the file (using the path)"
   1. Start at `/`, find the inode for the directory
   2. Read block that contains the inode
   3. Traverse the data in the block to find the inode for `foo`
   4. Repeat for `bar`
   5. Allocate a file descriptor for the file, and return, checking file permissions   
   
2. `read ()` "Actually read the file, given the inode"
   1. Read in the first block, use inode to find block location  
      - If the offset is past EOF, do nothing 
   2. Update inode accessed time
   3. Update file offset

3. When closing the file, deallocate the file descriptor only 

#### Writing a file to disk

1. Same `open ()` as above

2. `write ()` "Actually write the file, given the inode"
   1. If the offset is past EOF, need to extend the file  
      - May need to allocate new blocks, update inode, and freemap
   2. Read the inode from disk
   3. Write the data to existing/new blocks  
      - Depending on indexing strategy, may need to write new indirect blocks
   4. Update inode with new length, and write serialized inode to disk

### Placement Problems in UNIX FS
> Generates long seeks

1. Data blocks allocated randomly in aging file system
   - Initial blocks are allocated contiguously, but later blocks are allocated randomly (fragmentation from deletion)

2. Inodes allocated far from blocks
   - Access paths operations requires going back and forth between inode and data blocks

### File Interfaces

- **File Descriptors**: Managed by the OS
  - `STDIN` is 0, `STDOUT` is 1 (reserved)
  - All other open files are identified by a unique integer
  - System calls use the file descriptor to identify the file
  - Can also be used for pipes, and sockets

- **File Pointers**: Managed by the C library
  - `FILE *` is a pointer to a `struct FILE` (defined in `stdio.h`)
  - Contains the file descriptor, and a buffer for reading/writing
  - Use `fopen ()`, `fclose ()`, `fread ()`, `fwrite ()`, ... to manipulate
  - Used for regular files

#### Questions

1. Why do we need to open files before reading/writing them?
   - Need to load the file into memory, and allocate a file descriptor, in order to manipulate it
     - `open ()` calls `filesys_open ()`, which calls `inode_open ()`, which loads the serialized inode into memory
   - Files occupy multiple blocks, need to load the inode to find the blocks
     - We don't need to load all the blocks at once, just where they are located
   - To check permissions of the file, if the user is allowed to read/write to the file

2. Why do we need to close files when done with them?
   - Resource management: FDs are a limited resource, need to free them up
   - File operations may be under a lock, so threads/processes may be blocked
   - Security vulnerability, if the file is still open, it can be manipulated by other processes
   - Write operations may be written to a buffer, closing the file flushes the buffer

3. Why did we not have to open STDOUT before using `printf ()`?

### BSD Fast File System (FFS) 
> Improves performance by exploiting locality

![Cylinder Group](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099685474748080249/image.png)

#### Clustering in FFS

1. Put sequential blocks in adjacent sectors
2. Place inode near file data in the same cylinder
3. Try to keep all inodes in a directory in the same cylinder group (allocation group)

#### Solutions in FFS

1. The Large File Exception
   - Problem: Putting all blocks for a large file in the same cylinder group hurts locality
   - Use a multi-level index block to store the file's blocks, store blocks in different cylinder groups
     - **Indirect blocks**: 1 indirect pointer to a block of direct pointers
     - **Double indirect blocks**: 1 indirect pointer to a block of indirect pointers

2. Problem: Small block size in UNIX (1K)
   - Low bandwidth and small max file size
   - Use a larger block (4k)

3. Added Symbolic Links 

4. Problem: Media failures
   - Duplicate master block (superblock) 

5. Problem: Device Obliviousness
   - Use a generic block layer, so that it doesn't matter if HDD or SSD
   - Modern systems hide device details from the file system

![amoritization](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099692537595306054/image.png)

### Links

#### Hard Links

- Several dir entires point to the same inode
- UNIX counts number of hard links to an inode
- inode is free'd only when all links are removed (rm)
- If the original file is deleted/moved, the link is not broken

#### Symbolic (Soft) Links

- Just a special file (symlink) with a path to another file
- Type of symlink is stored in the inode
- If the original file is deleted/moved, the link is broken, but the file still exists 

### Buffer Cache

![buffer cache](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099721687857119232/image.png)

#### Read Ahead

- FS preloads the next block into the buffer cache, predicting that it will be needed soon
- Great for sequential accessed files, unless blocks are scattered across the disk
  - FS tries to prevent this during allocation

### Protecting Files

- **Protection System**: Access control mechanism for files
  - Owner 
  - Group (UNIX)
  - Permissions
    - Read
    - Write
    - Execute

- **Access Control List (ACL)**: List of users and permissions for a file
  - For each file, a list of users and their permissions
  - For each user, a list of files and their permissions

![ACL](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099722935754829935/image.png)


### Crash Consistency

- File system data structures must persist, retain data on disk even if the system shuts down
  - Either unexpectedly (crash, power loss) or planned (graceful shutdown)

![crash consistency](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975189796412604480/1099725759494496297/image.png)

- Consider appending to an already open file, this is not atomic and a crash can happen at any of these steps:
  1. Write to the inode
  2. Write to the freemap (if allocating a new block)
  3. Write to the data block

#### Crash Scenarios

1. Only one of the steps succeeds
   1. Only the inode is updated (**File Inconsistency**)
      - Inode points to some data block, thinking that the file has data there
      - But it doesn't, so that data block contains garbage

   2. Only the freemap is updated (**Space leak**)
      - Bitmap claims that the block is allocated, but it is not
      - Wasting an entire block that could actually be used

   3. Only the data block is updated
      - Not a problem, since the inode is not updated
      - OS will not know that the data block is allocated, so it will be overwritten later

2. Only 2 (out of the 3) steps succeed
   1. Inode and freemap are updated, but data block is not
      - The block that the inode claims has data in, contains garbage
      - FS metadata is consistent
  
   2. Inode and data block are updated, but freemap is not
      - Block is inconsistent with the freemap, thinking that it is free
      - Freemap will (eventually) overwrite the data block, so the data will be lost

   3. Freemap and data block are updated, but inode is not
      - Similar to just the data block being updated
      - No clue which file the data block is allocated for
      - Would not get overwritten, since the freemap knows its allocated
      - Inconsistent with the inode, so really just wasting space

### Journaling
> A solution to crash consistency

- Allows the file system to recover from a crash, by keeping a log of all file system operations
  
- Before performing an operation, write it to the log
  
- If a crash happens, the file system can replay the log to recover
  
- Small section of disk is partitioned just for the journal
  - Journal is a circular buffer, so it will eventually overwrite itself (due to finite partition size)
  
#### Writing to the log:

1. **TxB**: Transaction Begin marker
   - Contains transaction identifier (TID)
2. **Physical Loggings**: Write the (exact block content) data to the log
3. **TxE**: Transaction End marker
   - Contains same TID


#### Checkpoint

- Once journal is safely updated, ready to update the actual FS
- Issue the three writes to the FS
  1. Write the inode
  2. Write the freemap
  3. Write the data block

#### Recovery during checkpoint crash (successful journal log)
> Scan the log for completed transactions

- Find the last TxB and TxE
- All operations between these two markers are part of the same transaction 
- Just replay the transaction, since the data was physically logged in the journal
- If TxE is missing, then the transaction is incomplete
  - The data was not written to the log, so the update is lost
  - The FS is still consistent, since the checkpoint was not reached

#### Recovery during Journal write crash

- Internally, the disk may write the journal data in any order (abstraction of sectors to linear blocks)
- TxB and TxE might be written before physical loggings, 
  - If disk lost power before writing the data blocks, then the transaction is incomplete but may appear complete

1. Split transaction into two (atomic) transactions: TxB + Phys, and TxE
   - If disk loses power during first transaction, no big deal, as if nothing was logged
   - If lost during the second transaction, TxE never gets written, so the entire transaction is lost/skipped anyway

2. One single transaction, but include a **Journal Checksum** (commit)
   - TxB, Phys, Checksum, then TxE
   - Checksum is computed from all the data in the transaction (including TxB and TxE)
   - When replayed, the entire transaction is valid if the checksum is correct (recompute and compare)

#### Metadata Journaling

- Log only the metadata (inode + bitmap) changes
- Data blocks are written to the filesystem directly, not the journal

1. Write the data block to the FS 
2. Journal TxB and Metadata
3. Journal Checksum commit
4. Journal TxE
5. Checkpoint metadata (inode, bitmap)
   - FS is consistent if it crashes before this step
6. Free: Update the journal superblock (this journal log can be overwritten)
